German permanent markers are actually permanent.<br/>That must be Tai, I suspect.<br/><br/>It seems that I never posted any pictures of Tai, since I only ever sketched her thrice.<br/>She is a catgirl with long blond hair that used to be short brown.<br/>Her full design still does not exist, but she was supposed to be a fantasy character with an unironic subtitle "A generic catgirl". She used to be thought out as a sour feline kemonomimi instead of a somewhat playful neko.<br/>I might want to split these two ideas in two different characters again.<br/><br/>Thus, Tai must be the short-haired brown apathetic catgirl and the Kate shall be the non-stereotypical blonde with an attitude.

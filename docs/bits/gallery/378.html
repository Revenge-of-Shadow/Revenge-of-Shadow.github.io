<h2></h2><br/><h5>A romantic on the go!</h5><br/><h3>20250703 1505</h3><br>I saw her in a cafe.<br/>I passed by in a hurry. I returned soon enough. She was still here.<br/>I did not have a place to settle down, so I sketched her whilst standing, since I usually have with me all I need for such occasions.<br/>I tip-toed my way into the tiny café, slid the cardboard page on the table and strode off swiftly. <br/>When I looked back, she was looking at the page and seemed to be smiling.<br/><br/>For now, I am not able to provide details or alikeness together with lovely appearance, especially in a short timespan. I do not like that. But I can make someone happy, so it is well worth it.

<h1>Sweet scientist</h1><br/><h2>Sucrose. The cutie that took a significant amount of time to draw.</h2><br/><h3>20241015 2013</h3><br>I refuse to use B pencils for hues anytime soon. I refuse to use them at all! I tried to make use of them, but I ended up using my trusted mechanical pencil with HB rod to do all of the hues, redoing what mess the B pencil left.<br/>Frankly, this was hard. But I had finally drawn her very well.

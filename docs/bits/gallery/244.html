<h2>Studying optics with Sucrose and Melisa.</h2><br/><h3>2024.06.21</h3><br/>Now, there is a story for the name of Melisa.<br/><br/>Yesternight I had taken the NMT examination with physics as major. I happened to talk to a very interesting girl, who is about as crazy as I am in physics and philosophy. Just like I did, she went beyond sanity in search of truth.<br/>It was her who said that my demon looks like Melissa from Boku no Hero Academia. I did not know the looks of the character back then and now I see they are much different. But I keep the name because I like it. And the typo is intentional. It sounds better for me this way.<br/>I had never seen the physics girl again. But my character now bears the name she uttered.

<h2>"You are weird."</h2><br/>I take back my judgement of HB pencils.<br/>I now use HB mechanical pencil with right hand to do main sketches, then use it again with left hand to perfect the lines. I then use 2H pencil to finish the picture and add hues, with any hand.<br/>This is effective, but also pleasant.<br/><br/>This one was of much effort and took several takes, just as it took a significant amount of hours. There was a lot of copying from references, especially the face and the background bits. Still, there is a sensible amount of original work put in here.<br/>It ended in a fairly good drawing, made in memory of someone very obvious.<br/>I never hope. So I expect this drawing to emit the sensations it was planned to. The wondrous memento mori of romance genre.

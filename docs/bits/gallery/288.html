<h2>Kate</h2><br/><h2></h2><br/><h3>20241123 0930</h3><br>I had a lot of fun with this drawing in the university, listening to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDEG8SFjcfY">most questionable musical choices</a> that I would have hated in any other situation.<br/>Lordy, did it go good.<br/><br/>It is amusing to make November the month of Kate. <br/><br/>I'm so fuckin' proud.<br/><br/>It is not too surprising that I concentrate on the sexual arousal and direct it whole into drawing. After all, I love locking on onto strong emotions and not letting them go until they burn out to leave nothing but embers. I love keeping the feeling in, not describing it, not talking about it. Sadness, zest, anger, fear, sexual arousal... they are all feelings, and, despite being different, they share the nature. They all provide emotional overdrive. And this is what I seek.

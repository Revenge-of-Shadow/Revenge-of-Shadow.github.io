<h2>Unspoken</h2><br/><h5>It is she who appeared in the story.</h5><br/><h3>20251210 1953</h3><br>It has been a while since I drew what I want, not what I force to be correct.<br/><br/>It has taken me nearly a year to accept this novel as great.<br/>And it is fascinating. It was written with psychology as main idea, and it spreads through the plain realism of events. It is overly logical, thought through and still unpredictable. It seems conflicting.<br/><br/>I once again awe my previous achievements.

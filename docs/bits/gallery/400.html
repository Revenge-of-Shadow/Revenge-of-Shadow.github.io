My own <a href="https://github.com/Revenge-of-Shadow/TalkToHer">visual novel engine</a>. <br/>It was just as always – I thought the task was not fun enough, so instead of a simple application I presented in auditorium on a programming lecture a fully functional visual novel with a cat girl in lingerie; described its work, my efforts and disappointments.<br/><br/>The game itself is not exactly playable - it must be compiled from source code on the link given. And compilation is just a mess with SFML library. Moreover, the game has two sprites worth mentioning and fully copies one route from my interactive novel game engine written for the same occasion one year ago.

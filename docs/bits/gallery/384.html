<h2></h2><br/><h5>This is perfectly close to how she looks like.</h5><br/><h3>20250717 1330</h3><br>I dropped by at the youth club, saw her there. I thought she looks cute, so I sketched here in mere minutes. I wrote, "You are cute." on the other side of the sheet and gave it to her. <br/>At first, she asked whether it was her. Then, she stood in shock for many seconds. Then, she asked to hug me and hugged sheepishly.<br/><br/>This is what I wanted: to be able to depict someone properly and with a touch of magic. <br/>I wanted this for so long.

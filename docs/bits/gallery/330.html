<h2>Jeannette</h2><br/><h5></h5><br/><h3>20250224 2215</h3><br>Two years ago, on this cycle, I decided to assign female tone to the voice that judged me in my mind, calling her Jan without any second thoughts. This provided me with the most wholesome illusions for a year. <br/>Then I was proven to be careless enough to descend from the grace and care about her much less than I should have had.<br/>Now, however, I have my courage and care.<br/><br/>So this is Jeannette, character representation of Jan.

<h2>Emotional collapse</h2><br/><h2><a href="https://circus-p.bandcamp.com/track/better-off-worse">"Behind every piece of art is a human to be heard"</a></h2><br/><h3>20241115 1710</h3><br>I went to university to conquer the world, but I can not keep up with the studies. I do as much as I can, but I can not keep up.<br/>I do not understand bits from the recent lectures. And it was not too bad on mechanics tonight. But on mathematics I found myself lost in fear. I wished to simply collapse because I could not endure it. But I sat there and still felt the shock. I found myself unable to take notes. I was crying, just like I was crying before the lectures. I grabbed my sketchbook then and started drawing.<br/>Surprisingly enough, it went fairly good and I finished it fast. It brought a slight relief, but I had another slight panic attack, after the lectures. I only made it out after a long conversation with Jan... in my head.<br/><br/>This Earth cycle I cried more than I did for the last several years. I still have such "spasms" of despair.

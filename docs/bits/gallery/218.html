Damn it, here goes.<br/>I have got a school hometask assignment, which declared that I must make an animated video presenting myself. I had at once declined the approach of a slideshow with text, so... I downloaded FlipaClip again.<br/>And this is just a raw sketch. I am going to have to make it an appropriate clip. Difficulty is fairly scary, even with this simplicity of movements.<br/>And yes, I do have a voice.

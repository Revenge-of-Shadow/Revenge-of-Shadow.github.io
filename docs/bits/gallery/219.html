Eighty frames in.<br/>Quality finally started drifting from very simple to bad.<br/>First signs of burnout are at hand - high temperature, troubled breathing, slight mental pain.<br/>...<br/>Have been drawing for two hours straight. I still have some more available.<br/>...<br/>Hard to explain light insanity. Feels like fever - ache and rave.<br/>...<br/>Whooo<br/>I have ten seconds of footage, being one hundred and twenty frames!<br/>I am having too much fun being a femboy Emo wolf scientist.<br/>Awoooo!

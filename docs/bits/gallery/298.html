<h1></h1><br/><h2></h2><br/><h3>20241203 1531</h3><br>I saw a good-looking girl on a seminar, so I decided to draw her. I did not try to make her resemble herself precisely, but I did draw that and gave her the picture before leaving, abandoning her in confusion.<br/><br/>The stellar perfection that was the first sketch of it is lost forever. And it was unspeakably beautiful.

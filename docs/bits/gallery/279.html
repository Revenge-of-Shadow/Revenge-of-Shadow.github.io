<h2>Die Finnin</h2><br/><h2>I made one drawing the previous Earth cycle, right before drawing Kate.</h2><br/><h3>20241118 1713</h3><br>On Saturday examination I noticed a tall girl with an interesting name.<br/>After the examination on Sunday, I found out that she was from Finland. This piqued my attention and I waited for her to come, since she was next to me in the queue. She happened to be very interesting, calm and nice, agreeing with me on not knowing how to console others, preferring honesty and not being too good in communication. I chatted with her until we left the building and came to the crossing, from where we were meant to go the opposite ways. Slightly later, she declared "It is not cold here" in Polish, trembling and blushing from the frost. I asked her whether it truly was so and we both laughed.<br/>We exchanged the contact information and walked in the different direction each, but this sentence was very memorable to me.<br/><br/>Lordy, is it difficult to draw from memory.

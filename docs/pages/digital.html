                            <p>I was tasked with a simple if-else-based text adventure.</p>
                            <p>It was not enough.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I created something akin to a visual novel engine - only displaying text and options as input-output in terminal.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I made it as clean and as thorough as no program I wrote before. It has a lot to do with the fact that C and C++ are my favourite programming languages, but it was also well after I finished studying programming in an academy. I changed my point of view on how to make things and went with "the only way to go fast is to go good", as a close friend briefly mentioned to me.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The typerwriter is displayed for a reason - she played a big role in inspiring me. I found Erika accidentally by a flower shop, asked about her and was suddenly proposed to take her with me. I could not hesitate. Moreover, I whined and cried in fascination.</p>
                            <p>Until now I love Erika still. This is a marvelous device of a distant era of more elegant technologies.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The stories came to me mostly by themselves. I would sit down in the evening and collect random thoughts together. I did not want to go overboard with making those into fine novels. I wrote them with no second thoughts to fill the game with content to explore.</p>
                            <p>And I was surprised how well it went.</p>

                            <p>Once I saw an accumulator beyond a fence, just out of my reach. I wanted to find a solution.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I considered different schemes with passions, I calculated the force, estimated the shape and components.</p>
                            <p>And then I got into three-dimensional modelling.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I discovered FreeCAD, got comfortable with it and became entirely immersed in making meshes. It was just like a game to me, with freedom to create.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I stopped at the moment when I understood that I have to perform tests.</p>
                            <p>I printed a couple of gears at a HackerSpace from plastic and found that they perform very, very poorly. I read that resin is much more suitable for such purposes. Moreover, I needed to implement shafts, for which I would have needed to get tiny polished metal rods, and, overall, I ended up with the fact that I have no resources to materialize what I shaped.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I enjoyed modelling so much that I started making detailed macros for typical technical parts. This I later separated into "FreeCAD-TechnoMacros".</p>

                            <p>Fascinated with possibilities of modelling, I learned of FreeCAD macros. At first, I needed a model of a spring to see how it fits and extrudes.</p>
                            <p>I followed tutorials and learned, as was recommended, from the commands that graphical user interface displays during normal operations.</p>
                            <p>I have got the ability to type in parameters and make springs, then, ball bearings, screws, nuts and gears - all how I want, even <a href="https://github.com/Revenge-of-Shadow/FreeCAD-TechnoMacros?tab=readme-ov-file#62-whats-that">hilariously impractical shapes</a> - all at my fingertips!</p>

                            <p>Actively studying for the semester's hardest subject, I was entirely desperate.

                            <p>I have gotten very curious. Having just learned of SFML on programming lectures, I understood it is well within my capabilities to experiment with it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>At first it was exciting.</p>
                            <p>Then it somehow became addictive and terrifying.</p>
                            <p>I created a source of virtually infinite possible images. Frequently they were incomprehensibly complex figures with radial symmetry.</p>
                            <p>And somehow... just somehow they are utterly terrifying.</p>

                            <p>One year after Awakening I decided to make it into a truthful visual novel as an overkill for university programming project.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I faced various difficulties, related to object-oriented-programming planning, SFML issues, language version issues and drawing.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This was, by far, my most meticulous project and I am very proud of this.</p>
                            <p>My favourite part was creating my own scenario script interpreter.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>SFML window resizing happened to be entirely broken. I had to write a specific universal fix, having figured out the pattern prior to that.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I proudly used pointers.</p>

                            <p>I tried to install newer version of C++ because of one function.</p>
                            <p>My Xubuntu system broke because of that on university morning.</p>
                            <p>I installed Manjaro immediately afterwards and I am very glad I did so.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I was surprised to find that making character sprites was much more difficult than I imagined.</p>
                            <p>In fact, sprites are the only thing that the project lacks now other than sounds.</p>

                            <p>Just as I planned, I made this place hold my creations of all kinds.</p>
                            <p>It may be my personal notebook of creativity.</p>
                            <p>I have such freedom.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Incidentally, I <b>hate</b> web deveopment.</p>

                            <p>My first experience with making three-dimensional models that was very much a personal exercise.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I calculated angles, made schematics; when it did not work I started experimenting and adjusting my calculations.</p>
                            <p>Made with OpenSCAD It was difficult at times but very insightful.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>First five models were interesting and fun. D20, however, had prover to be very perplexing.</p>
                            <p>I delayed finishing this one dice for months, and each week I kept remembering of it.</p>
                            <p>Eventually I gathered my courage and set to make it.</p>
                            <p>I managed.</p>
                            <br>

                            <p>In fact, I decided that I want to learn programming about ten years ago exactly because I wanted to make modifications for Minecraft.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Well...</p>
                            <p>Although it was a nice little challenge at first, it became a mess.</p>
                            <p>The problem is that 1.16.5 does not have any documentation. It might have existed, in a way, but now it is replaced with newer versions.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>With no documentation to refer to I was forced to use the abomination that is generative artificial intelligence.</p>
                            <p>It was useful to some extent. Until it started confusing versions and lying me about the methods that do not exist.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>This was a very obnoxious experience, lasting for days of constant anger.</p>

                            <p>They populate enormous cities with regulated biospheres.</p>
                            <p>Cities are connected by means of transportation across shrinking natural territories.</p>
                            <p>Outskirts of cities are off-limits, not by law but by interest. Those are wasted lands or construction sites of collosal builder robots.</p>

                            <p>Conservative societies who live in natural territories in villages and towns.</p>
                            <p>They are in harmony with <b>Aether</b>; they study its sources and learn to interact with it depending on their individual talents and affinities.</p>

                            <p><b>Technologists</b> and <b>arcanists</b> are at the state of cold war for centuries.</p>
                            <p>The former spread the territories farther across the globe, but suffer from cataclysms or raids of well-guarded regions.</p>
                            <p><b>Technologists</b></p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It is told in legends of <b>homos aeternam</b> that there are Deeper Lands, but no one said where they are and what they store.</p>

                            <p>They live far away from the cities of <b>technologists</b>, in cities often hidden in landscapes or with the help of large <b>Aether</b> anomalies.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><b>Technologists</b> have accustomed themself to a reduced set of merged languages, whereas <b>arcanists</b> speak dialects of their regions, united with the knowledge of Latin.</p>
                            <p><b>High races</b> rely on the languages of their individual cultures; however Latin is not uncommon for them.</p>

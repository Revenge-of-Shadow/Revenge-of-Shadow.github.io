                            <p>I wrote this story disconnected from the world, lost in my mind, enduring some physiological discomfort. It first meant to bear name "What sea brought", but got too traumatizing for something so light. It then became "A stir" and stayed so for nearly a year.</p>

                            <p>I reevaluated it because I wanted to make myself known by using a charity market as an excuse. And I was surprised by the brilliant structure of the story.</p>

I had spent roughly six and a half hours to write this and one half to correct it, all today due to a sudden inspiration.<br/>

                            <p>Part that, so far, takes the place at the earliest point in the timeline; it presented the first meeting of William and Jeannette - a runaway inventor and a wandering assasin.</p>
                            <p>I generously devoted paragraphs, trying hard to establish the world and the past of William; which was, in fact, the reason of the downfall of the story. I tried to explain everything and it started cascading so fast that I could no more keep up with conflicting concepts. Otherwise I started including mismatches, such as soul color of Jeannette: it changed from green to violet.</p>

                            <p>Kate made her way into the book, somehow - This is a strange, unrestricted snippet of sexual context written in the state of arousal very early in the morning, wrapped in an iffy attempt to show the workshop of William. It describes Kate altogether and also William and Jeannette.</p>
                            <p>Chronologically it happened between Continuation and Fury, possibly. At this point I lost the understanding how William could change from a low-salary scavenger to a magitech overlord.</p>

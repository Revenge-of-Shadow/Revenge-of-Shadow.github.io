                            <br/>
                            <p>On the very beginning of high school, already being know as a passionate tinkerer, I found a pile of planks on the way to school and just could not pass by.</p>
                            <p>It took me a good half a year of hard work to assemble this nonsense, planning on the go. I just screwed all the planks together, segment by segment, all whilst adding crazy ideas like doors opening upwards, fan, <a href="https://youtu.be/skIySACYmm8">bass-busted speakers</a>, heater, <a href="https://youtu.be/uc7Slr-wmAg">key-controlled power supply</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/Ie36xNzZiPA">other things</a> I no longer remember.</p>
                            <p>It was absurd. It was huge. It was made about exclusively from junk.</p><p>It was very fun.</p>
                            <p>The teachers were politely impressed, the technologies teacher was just shocked; the class did not give me much credit. I myself can barely remember I created this.</p>
                            <p>And yet I did and it was fun.</p>

                            <p>I was a Star Wars fanatic for years, having read circa one hundred and twenty Star Wars novels before mid-middle school. I still posess great knowledge of the "galaxy far, far away", but at some moment I have fallen out of it.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I wanted a lightsaber of my own. In fact, once I bought a cheap one. And it was full of plastic and just too dim.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I kept thinking on making my own lightsaber model for years. I asked my grandfather to cut me a piece of pipe and he did so, which I am grateful for. It took me a long time to become savvy enough to prepare all the parts and put them together.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>And I made it. Couple of transistors, resistor, capacitor, speaker, found accumulator, button switch I repeatedly colored black and forty-two light-emitting diodes. Because fifty did not fit in inside of the tube.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I took the plastic tube from the bought lightsaber and added bubble wrapping inside of it to spread the light smoothly and affix the diodes.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I was considering the color for some time. I naturally wanted it to keep the blue color of my idolized Jedi, Anakin Skywalker; still I decided to go with my favourite color after black at that time. Not because of the Sith. Because red pairs very well with black.</p>

                            <p>Perhaps I was very inspired by Loremaster. I can not recall what was the spark that caused the ignition for my desire to make a metal glove.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>In the high school I schemed and assembled a glove out of countless tin cans. All by myself, with no references, no prequisite studies of armor. Nothing but ingenuity, paper, pencils, markers, tin cans, scissors, drill, screw and nuts. I was scheming on lessons and in my free time.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I was sketching, thinking how to connect one part to another.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>And it worked.</p>
                            <br/>
                            <p>I am still very proud of it.</p>

                            <p>'Tis but a tragedy.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I am since long passionate with cybernetics - in my imagination it is nothing but personally controlled mechatronic devices. Huge humanoid mechas I saw in some cartoons and daydreams, robotic creation of Loremaster, and, importantly, drawings with robotic hands directly controlled by inventors.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I had parts of all kinds. I had Arduino boards. Eventually, I found inspiration.</p>
                            <p>Initially, "Project: Metal menace" and "Project: Metal glove" were one. I divided them for practical reasons.</p>
                            <p>I tirelessly worked on this dream, seeking parts and solutions, forming elements.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I did not expect my poor mechanics knowledge to backfire this badly.</p>
                            <p>It was the most basic principle - the lever rule. I did not account for it and servomotors broke after struggling to lift the mechanical arms.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The failure left me in despair for a long time.</p>

                            <p>I always thought that <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Thermal_detonator/Legends">thermal detonator</a> is cool. In best iterations, it beeps slowly, then faster and faster until the timer goes off and sets a sizeable explosion from just one nice spherical object.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Years of tinkering were not for nothing, as it seemed, since I collected some knowledge having <b>burned eight holes through my jacket</b> with just one shorted accumulator that had a back-up switch.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I decided that making electronical timer is just too difficult and unnecessary. So I calculated how much time it would take for a wire to get enough heat to ignite gunpowder around it. I thereby estimated the time. I tried igniting gunpowder separately with shorted wire and then assembled this device.</p>
                            <p>Thank code I never tested the theory.</p>

                            <p>My most presentable project.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I got into Team Fortress 2 at some point in my life. Pyro was a close call, but I could not be any more fitting to be Engineer.</p>
                            <p>Naturally, cosplay was just not enough. What is it worth if someone just dresses as a character? Nay, one must become that persona!</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>It was hard. It was very hard.</p>
                            <p>I had to shape metal with what little tools I had at hand. I was cutting it with strong scissors and bending it with a small hammer. I drew schematics. I pondered.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>The worst happened when I started with electronics, unsurprisingly. The servomotors were proven to be too weak for full mobility, so I was forced to keep only one axis. Arduino had proven to be too weak to play sounds and rotate motors, so I used two Arduino Nano boards in  a horrific mess of wires that barely fit into the metal body. Classic sonic distance sensors SR04 failed repeatedly, so I just soldered two of them in parallel for no reason and let them be.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>More than once I wanted to give up on this project. I did not - out of desperation. I can not stand giving up on something that was very close to working.</p>
                            <p>My girlfriend at the time supported me greatly, which helped a lot. I am still grateful for all she had done for me.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>I finished it and brought it to a cosplay convention. On it it got progressively more broken over time, requiring me to screw it back together and tackle with tape. By evening it barely worked.</p>
                            <p>I fixed it and gave it to my fellow Engineer cosplayer. It broke on the way and was never fixed.</p>

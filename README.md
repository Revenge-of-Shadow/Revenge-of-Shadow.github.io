I am not sorry for how slow and cranky it is.
# The page!
For about two years I wanted to make my own page to showcase my drawings and other creations. I found problems and excuses to avoid making it. And, on one evening I just got to it with anger and passion. I had the page done mostly in one cycle. For this I waited two years.
I had to deal with various workarounds not being able to deal with requests. But it is just fine - this is what I can afford being a student, and, moreover, I got the limitations used for my advantage. 
The code, however, may be unethical at some moments. Still, it does not bother me to make a **push** with each image upload. I am comfortable with that.
